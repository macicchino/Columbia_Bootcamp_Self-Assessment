# Columbia Bootcamp Self-Assessment : Michael Cicchino

Self-Assessment for Final Project of Columbia Data Bootcamp - Food_Insecurity

## Project Summary: 

Our team analyzed USDA data relating to Food Insecurity, specifically physical locations of food vendors per capita. 
We were able to accuratly predict % changes in Food Insecurity using a Machine Learning algorithm. We elected to use Supervised Machine Learning, specifically an Ensemble learner. We eventaully chose a Balance Random Forest Classifier as the best model to predict our target variable.

## Self-Assessment:

#### Assessment of Analysis 

Over the course of the project I held two primary roles. One as the driver of next steps and initiatives through leading team meetings, setting schedules and managing the github. The second was contributing to the data transformation, and model analysis. I primarly focused on optimizing the model and interpretting it's results. 

My greatest personal challenge during the course of the project was utilizing my team members individual strengths. As we worked together over the weeks our team was able to identify our relative strengths and weaknesses. By the end of the project, we had built a productive workflow and was able to really function as a team. In the future, I would like to spend more time early in the project identifying team members individual strengths to accelerate our growth into a cohesive Team. 

I was able to help drive processes for the other team members tasks by setting out objectives and deadlines. Dividing up the project into research, data collection, data processing, model analysis, and presentation allowed us to efficiently work through the project. The other team member primarly lead the data exploration and presentation, while I focused on the analysis and various models. 

## Project and Team Summary:

Communication Protocols: 

Our team periodically met over zoom and communicated over slack. Specifically, we held additional meetings on Wednesdays inbetween our normal class hours to clarify our deliverables for Thursday and resolve any issues. We used slack as the first means of communication, specifically communicating any changes or notifying other members of branch merges. In the future, I think it would have been helpful to meet some of the team members in person at the start of the project. In addition, I think re-summarizing everyones deliverables in slack would be helpful for everyone to keep track of other team members work processes. 

Team Strengths: 

We were able to identify our teams key strengths early on. Brenton was the leader in the data exploration, Vasily largly handled the data processing, and Woyram/Emery were in pivotal in presenting the data in a concise manor. I think our team's greatest strength was it's willingness to contribute and overall great attitude brought to each meeting. 

Topic addressed:

Machine learning Model:

  We utilized a Supervised Machine Learning Model. Specifically a Balanced Random Forest Classifier. 

Results of the Analysis:

  We were able to see that the per capita % change of Convenience Stores was the most influencial feature in predicting food insecurity. Upon further research, we confirmed the results of our analysis, as food insecure areas are usually dependent on Conveninece stores as a source of food.
